# only-a-cat-knows
Only a cat knows why it turns. What draws it, almost instinctively, to shift
its attention. How many generations of psychic meaning, biological carving of
inherited formation, have offered us this one ineluctable form of expression?
Only a cat knows.

There are two video pieces. Both pieces are both invoked from the command line, 
e.g.:

```
$ cd only-a-cat-knows
$ ./treasure_hunt.py
```

or

```
$ cd only-a-cat-knows
$ python treasure_hunt.py
```
A matplotlib window will open displaying the video animation. `cat_dynamics.py` 
is a library of supporting functions used in the scripts.

## inherited_formation.py
This is a piece for ~10 performers, based on the Vicsek model
([Vicsek, Tamás et al. 1995. Physical Review Letters. 75 (6): 1226–1229)](https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.75.1226)
### Rules:
  * Each performer is assigned a cat (labeled).
  * Each performer may play while their cat is in-bounds.
  * Performers should be cognizant of which cats are near their cat.
  * The piece moves through three worlds; each should sound distinct.

## treasure_hunt.py
This is a piece for three performers on a single instrument. Interactions are 
Newtonian, mediated through 12th-order polymolial repulsion.
### Rules:
  * Each performer is assigned a cat (labeled).
  * The map is divided into two regions: air and water.
  * When a performer's cat is in the water, they play on one part of the
  instrument. When their cat is in the air, they play on a different and
  very distinct part of the instrument.
  * Left-to-right position of each cat should correspond to a continuous
  parameter (pitch, tempo, volume, lyricism, lightness, etc.) as agreed
  upon by the performers before the beginning of the piece.
